# Project Title

RefiChat

## Summary

a messaging platform (similar to Libraryh3lp) that includes an AI powered chatbot to increase the speed of communication and allow 24/7/365 service to library patrons. 


## Background

The RefiChat AI powered chatbot would allow limited 24/7/365 service to library patrons, including after hours, during scheduled closings, on holidays, etc. As an academic librarian my personal motivation would be to reach those library patrons we fail to serve during the aforementioned downtimes.

## How is it used?

RefiChat would be used in educational settings and would be utilized by all library patrons including academic and public librarians, professors, teachers, students, scholars, and researchers.

## Data sources and AI methods

The RefiChat AI powered chatbot would depend on library specific data sources, such as hours of operation, collection locations, classification used (for example, Librarty of congress or Dewey Decimal), etc. I believe Natural Language Processing (NLP) would be the most helpful AI technique to develop the AI powered chatbot.

## Challenges

Initially, the RefiChat AI powered chatbot would only be able to answer general questions such as library hours of operation, collection locations (for example, the Folio Collection is on the third floor), etc. and would not be able to answer more complex, in-depth reference queries. 

## What next?

As AI technology advances, RefiChat could expand and be able to answer more complex reference questions and one day become an artificial intelligenceâ€“powered academic library reference assistant. 


## Acknowledgments

Libraryh3lp is a fantastic messaging platform that I (and many other libraries) use on a regular basis. It is an effective, intuitive library tool. However, I think it could be improved with the use of an AI powered chatbot.
